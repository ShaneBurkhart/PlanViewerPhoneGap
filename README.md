#PlanViewer Mobile App

Written in JS and HTML, the app is built with PhoneGap.  This is the assets side of the app.
PhoneGap allows for one code base with multiple platforms.
The app uses backbone.js for view control.
The minimal code required for each platform is locally stored on my computer.


I don't recommend going this route for any kind of data heavy applications.  Becomes way too tedious.
